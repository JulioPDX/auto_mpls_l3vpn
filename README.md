# Automating MPLS L3VPNs with Nornir

## Getting Started

### Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulioPDX/auto_mpls_l3vpn.git
cd auto_mpls_l3vpn
```
### Create venv

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate venv

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Next Steps

At this point you can either copy the topology I have or build your own. Just note that you will have to match IP addressing to whatever you pick as well as interface naming. Wish you all the best and happy automating!
